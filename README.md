Code Examples Overview

I collected code examples to show how I conducted various statistical analyses on three datasets. 
My purpose was to explore my data and establish conclusions. I employed various analysis methods, and 
some were just out of curiosity. I am currently trying to improve my coding skills. Thus, although better versions 
were probably imaginable, those are sufficient for my expectations. I used the most definitive results to make my 
comparisons.

Overall, I used column summation, normality tests, and ANOVA when premises were met for parametric analysis. 
However, my data did not reveal a normal distribution. For such cases, I had to employ non-parametric tests such as Kruskal-Wallis. :)
